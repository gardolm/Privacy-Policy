      The game app reads game play progress and settings data for the app on the user's local device.

      We are able to provide the game for free or at a low cost by including optional advertisements for users to view in exchange for benefits in game. In order to better facilitate the advertising platform, certain information is shared with third-party advertising services, such as the user's advertising ID and IP-address. We also collect game performance and in game analytics such as game settings and game play tendencies in the game. This information allows us to better understand what features are preferred by users and to determine the effectiveness of the game's design. This understanding allows us to make improvements to the game in future updates and to identify and resolve any bugs or other user experience issues.

      Our advertising partners' platforms determine which ad to show at a given time, and by sharing certain information with them, they are able to provide targeted ads. You can control the use of your advertising ID in the settings on your device. By having access to this data, ad services will be able to limit the number of times a specific ad is shown on your device, make informed decisions of which ads are more likely to be relevant to your interests, and use your IP-address to see your general geographic area.
